        <p>Italian cuisine is highly regionalized. Dishes served commonly in 
            one area may not even be known in another. But overall, there is 
            a tendency to use fewer ingredients, but use ones of the highest 
            quality that can be sourced locally. The dishes are very simple, 
            unpretentious, but always seasonal and local. Butter and meat in 
            the North and olive oil and vegetables in the South. Seafood along 
            the coasts. Italian cuisine in Italy bears almost no resemblance 
            to Italian cuisine in other countries.</p>
